This directory contains custom scripts which pop up in stacker cli as commands.

There are two options:

1) *.yml 

Stacker will treat those as ansible playbooks and will invoke
ansible in the same way as with `deploy.yml` playbook.

2) *

Stacker will treat those as a normal executable and will run it
through shell
